I. I NTRODUCTION
Financial markets are a tricky space to navigate—stock prices
move in ways that can feel almost chaotic, which is why figur-
ing out how to predict them is such a big deal for researchers
and traders alike. A lot of the models we use today are focused
on one main question: are prices going up or down? They often
lean on things like technical charts, company fundamentals, or
even fancy algorithms to spot patterns. But while that’s useful,
there’s something these tools tend to skip over—the possibility
that prices might loop back to important levels they’ve already
touched during a trading day.
This research takes a different angle, aiming to estimate the
likelihood of a stock’s price revisiting specific points, like:
1) The price it opened at today
2) The opening price from yesterday
3) Yesterday’s closing price
I’ve spent some time looking at intraday price data from the
past, and it’s clear that stocks often circle back to these levels
more than you might expect. Instead of just chasing trends like
most models do, this approach zooms in on the odds of those
returns happening at certain times—like early in the morning
at 8:00 AM, around noon, or toward the end of the day at 4:00
PM. The idea is to give traders a better sense of when they
might see an opportunity.
A. Aim and Objectives
This research intends to address gaps in conventional stock
forecasting by creating a probability-driven model tailored
for the requirements of intraday trading. The objective is to
design a tool that will offer traders a competitive edge by
enhancing precision, timing, and risk management. Here’s
what the project aims to accomplish:
•Analyze the frequency with which prices return to im-
portant reference points such as the day’s open, priorday’s open, or prior day’s close which are commonly
seen intraday trading.
•Determine the times of day when entering and exiting
trades would be most optimal, something which models
do not usually cater for.
•Forecast movements of price using the past intraday data,
placing greater emphasis on probabilities of reversions
rather than straightforwardly forecasting trends, which is
what most machine learning algorithms focus on.
•Ensure the model’s applicable scope is not limited to a
specific asset class so that it can be used in different
markets.
•Validate the model in a real trading environment for 30
days to assess performance in practical scenarios.
II. P ROBLEM DEFINITION
One of the biggest issues with a lot of prediction models
is that they assume stock prices follow a neat path—either
steadily climbing or dropping without much back-and-forth.
But if you’ve ever watched a trading session unfold, you know
that’s not how it works. Prices often bounce back to levels
they’ve hit before, sometimes several times in a day. That can
happen for all sorts of reasons—maybe there’s a sudden shift
in liquidity, or big institutional traders make a move, or the
market’s mood just changes [1]. When models don’t account
for this kind of behavior, they’re missing a big part of what
makes intraday trading so dynamic.
Then there’s another problem: these models don’t really line
up with how a trading day flows. Traders often make decisions
based on key moments—like the rush when the market opens,
the quieter stretch in the middle of the day, or the flurry of
activity right before the close. But most forecasting tools don’t
break things down that way. Even the really advanced machine
learning techniques, which are great at picking up on bigger
trends, usually don’t focus on the odds of a price returning
to a specific spot [2]. That leaves traders without the kind of
detailed insights they need to make the most of their timing.
Right now, most stock prediction efforts are all about direc-
tion—will the price go up or down? [3]. That’s a good starting
point, but it doesn’t tell you much about the likelihood of a
price swinging back to a past level, which is something that
matters a lot in short-term trading. This study is here to tackle
that gap with an approach that’s more focused on probabilities,
especially for intraday scenarios.
Another challenge with conventional models is their lack
of integration with specific intraday timeframes. Traders often
make decisions based on critical market hours, such as the
opening, midday, and closing periods. However, most forecast-
ing approaches do not analyze price movements within these
time-sensitive intervals, leading to suboptimal trading strate-
gies. Additionally, current machine learning models primarily
focus on predicting overall price trends rather than determining
the probability of price returning to key levels [2]. This creates
a gap in forecasting accuracy, as traders are unable to assess
the likelihood of price reversion at specific points in time.
Most existing stock price prediction models focus solely on
directional movements, aiming to predict whether a stock’s
price will increase or decrease [3]. While these models are
widely used, they lack the ability to provide probabilistic
insights into price reversion, which is a crucial aspect of short-
term market behavior.
III. L ITERATURE REVIEW
A. Machine Learning in Stock Price Forecasting
Machine learning has become a favorite tool for predicting
stock prices, and it’s easy to see why—it’s really good at
sorting through complicated financial patterns. Zhang et al. [1]
took a deep dive into models like Support Vector Machines,
Random Forests, and LSTM networks to see how well they
could predict price directions. They found that these methods
definitely improve accuracy, but they also noticed a catch: the
models struggle when the market gets messy, and they don’t
really deal with probabilities. I’ve taken a lot of inspiration
from their work, but I’m trying to go a step further by adding
a probabilistic angle to look at price reversion, while still using
machine learning to make the results more dependable.
B. Deep Learning for Temporal Dependencies in Stock
Markets
Deep learning, especially with LSTM networks, has been a
total game-changer when it comes to spotting patterns that
play out over time in stock data. Kumar and Lee [2] did
some interesting work comparing LSTM models to Random
Forests for predicting intraday movements in the S&P 500.
They found that LSTMs did better, pulling in a daily return
of 0.64% compared to 0.54% for Random Forests, which
makes sense since LSTMs are so good at handling sequences.But their study didn’t look at the odds of prices swinging
back to earlier levels, which is where I saw an opportunity.
I’m taking their approach as a starting point and mixing in
some probability calculations to estimate the chances of those
reversions happening, which I think could be really useful for
traders.
C. Probabilistic Models in Financial Forecasting
Some recent work has started to lean more toward prob-
abilistic approaches instead of just making flat-out guesses.
Qian et al. [3] came up with a Transformer-based network to
figure out the probability distribution of stock returns, and they
showed it’s more reliable than older methods like regression.
Wang et al. [4] also jumped in, using Hidden Markov Models
to study how markets shift between different states, which
really drives home how useful probability can be. I’m drawing
on their ideas here, but applying them specifically to intraday
price reversion, which hasn’t been explored as much as it
deserves.
D. Influence of Trading Volume on Intraday Stock
Movements
Trading volume has a huge impact on how prices move
during the day—it’s a big factor in liquidity and volatility.
Nguyen et al. [ ?] looked into how volume connects to price
reversions, putting together a model to predict volume chunks
throughout the day to help with forecasting. They noticed that
when volume spikes, prices often end up hitting key levels, but
they didn’t take the next step into a full probabilistic setup.
I’m building on that by weaving volume into my probability
model, so traders can get a better sense of when liquidity might
trigger a price swing.
E. Feature Engineering in Stock Price Forecasting
Getting the inputs right is so important for making predic-
tion models work well. Li and Chen [ ?] dug into using custom
features—like moving averages and momentum indicators—in
deep learning models to spot when trends might flip. They
found that choosing the right features makes a big difference,
even though they were mostly focused on direction. I’m taking
a similar approach, but tweaking it to focus on intraday re-
version odds, using things like how often prices have reversed
in the past and what the volume looks like at those turning
points.

IV. M ETHODOLOGY
A. Research Design
This study is guided by a detailed plan that systematically
addresses machine learning with probabilistic techniques to
address the challenges of intraday forecasting. Each step has
been thought through carefully to make sure the approach is
both thorough and practical, especially for a research project
at this level
1) Analysis Tools, Software, and Data Sources
This section breaks down the tools, software, and data
sources that will be used to make this research happen. A lot of
thought went into picking these to keep things manageable for
a master’s project while still being up to the task of handling
intraday forecasting. Here’s the rundown:
•Data Sources : Pulling historical and real-time data feeds
from Yahoo Finance (always free intraday goodies), Al-
pha Vantage (over 20 years of history), and perhaps
Bloomberg for pro-grade checks.
•Programming Environment : Python has been my fa-
vorite for quite sometimes now: Pandas and NumPy for
the time series heavy lifting, and Scikit-learn for my
initial models and metrics.
•Machine Learning Libraries : For LSTM/Transformer
builds, TensorFlow or PyTorch will do just fine. With
GPU juice for bigger data pulls.
•Probabilistic Modelling : HMMs (hmmlearn) and
Bayesian Networks (Pgmpy) cover the odds features,
and ever were Monte Carlo simulations for the “what
ifs”.
•Visualising and Dashboarding : Matplotlib and Seaborn
will do the charts while Plotly (Dash) provides for the
elegant real time UI
•Deployment framework :Serve it as an API with Flask or
Django, running on cloud or local rig for fast iterations.
Software : Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn,
Tensorflow/Pytorch, Flask/Django, Matplotlib, seaborn
and Plotly/Dash.
AI/ML Tools : HMMs, Bayesian Networks, LSTMs,
Transformers, Monte Carlo sims.
Testing Tools : Backtesting setups, MAPE, precision and
recall, 30 days out live trading sandbox.
V. E XPECTED OUTPUT
1) Benefits / Contributions
This research aims to deliver some practical benefits that
could make a real difference for traders. Here’s what’s ex-
pected from the model once it’s up and running:
1)Better Forecasting :This model steps up intraday predic-
tions with probability vibes—not just “here’s the price,”
but “here’s how likely it is,” giving traders a range to
play with and confidence to time things right.2)Smarter Decisions : With odds tied to key moves,
traders can pick their spots—like shorting if today’s
open looks likely to pull back—balancing risks and
wins better.
3)Real-Time Flexibility : The system will be designed to
keep up with live data, shifting gears if the market flips,
and ping traders with fresh insights fast.
4)Scalability : The model will be built to flex—stocks,
forex, crypto, whatever—and plug into trading plat-
forms, perfect for solo traders or big firms alike.
2) Limitations
No model is perfect, and this one will have its challenges to
watch out for. Here are some potential limitations that might
come up:
•Market Chaos : Sudden events can really shake things
up and mess with historical patterns—like major updates
from the Fed or unexpected market crashes—which might
cause the model to stumble when the market gets wild
and tough to predict.
•Tech Load : Crunching minute-by-minute data takes se-
rious horsepower; lag could be a pain in live trading.
•Data Risks : The saying “garbage in, garbage out” applies
here—if the data is messy or has gaps, the model’s
performance could take a hit. Clean, reliable feeds will
be essential for it to work well.
•Market Shifts : What worked in the past might not hold
up as markets change over time, so the model will need
regular tweaks to stay relevant and effective.
3) Ethical, Health, and Safety Issues
This project also takes into account some ethical and safety
concerns to ensure the model is used in a responsible way.
Here’s what’s on the radar:
•Privacy : Working with live market data means following
strict rules to keep everything secure and above board,
ensuring no sensitive information gets mishandled.
•Bias: If the historical data has any unnoticed imbalances,
the model might end up favoring certain outcomes in
ways that aren’t quite fair, so keeping things even and
balanced will be a big priority.
•Over-Reliance : Traders shouldn’t rely solely on the
model—outside factors like breaking news or gut
instincts still matter a great deal, and ignoring them
could lead to risks building up over time.
•Security : Since the system will be running live, strong
protections will be needed to guard against hacks or
breaches, which could be a big problem if not managed
well.
•Market Ripple : If a large number of traders start using
the model, it might unintentionally affect prices in strange
ways, so that’s something to keep an eye on.
VI. C ONCLUSION
This research offers a fresh perspective on stock price fore-
casting by focusing on a probability-based approach that cen-
ters on price reversion to key reference points. By blending
machine learning with probabilistic models, a tool has been
developed that traders can rely on to improve decision-making,
manage risks more effectively, and execute trades with greater
precision in the fast-paced world of intraday trading.
